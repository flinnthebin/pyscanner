# pyscanner

a python network scanning tool

## directions

pyscanner initial/current design based on cli tools with flags (-sw, ps, sn)

pyscanner-menu more in line with tools like metasploit using traditional navigation

TODO: integrate pyscanner-menu functionality, make whole experience arrow-navigation noob-friendly

pysnmp seems to be a depth of communication protocol understanding i am working towards. appreciate all suggestions.
